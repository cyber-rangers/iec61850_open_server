KNOWN BUGS:
BUG: most LN's assume a type of extref in the callback. include more error checking on this, as its not enforced by the SCL or by the loading mechanism
BUG: deallocation of mem. is not done nicely
BUG: scl items cannot contain spaces, not even desc. elements!
BUG: stack: lastapplerror is always set to unknown instead depending on the operation in the cmdterm
